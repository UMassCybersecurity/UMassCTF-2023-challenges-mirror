### Description

I love CTFs. I love em for the blockchain aspect. So when the first challenge is always the same, it makes me sad. Very sad.

So I made this. This is a combination of my expertise to make the perfect crafted beginner blockchain challenge. For this challenge, you'll need to know a bit about re-entrancy and then figure out some quirky little tricks to circumvent limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This doesn't need you to know any obscure material, but rather instead to thoroughly evaluate how to approach this problem and think strategically and intuitively about the tools at your disposal.

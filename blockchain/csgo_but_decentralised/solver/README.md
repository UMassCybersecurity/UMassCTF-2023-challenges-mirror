# CS:GO On Steroids Solver

This essentially sets up a local environment for automatically solving and debugging the challenge locally. This uses Paradigm's Forge and runs in a tested contained environment. This effectively allows for any reverse engineer to be able to solve the challenge much faster than if working directly with the platform itself.

To be able to run this, you need to pre-emptively [install Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

Once that's done, you may run the following command:

```
foundry test
```

And done, you've successfully exploited the program.
